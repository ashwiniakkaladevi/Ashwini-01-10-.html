                <h2  class="A" align="center">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology-based distance education is emerging as an increasingly<br>
visible feature of post-secondary education in the United States (U.S. Depart-<br>ment of Education, 1999). Technology is changing the way the university<br>
functions as an institution of higher learning. Publications such as <i>The<br>
Chronicle of Higher Education</i> regularly feature articles about the distance<br>
education efforts of various higher education institutions and systems, states,<br>
and consortia. Distance education specialists and academic policymakers<br>
expect technology to help higher education institutions provide a wide range<br>
of programs, including degree programs, to larger proportions of the student<br>
population (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In distance education, or distance learning, the students and instructors<br>
emain geographically apart. Today, the ability to take courses from a remote<br>
location utilizing the Internet is referred to as “e-learning” (Quan, 2000); e-<br>learning is the dot-com term for distance education. Concepts of lifelong<br>
learning, individualized or personalized learning, and time-free, space-free,<br>
“just-in-time” learning arrangements have emerged, all of which allow<br>
learning away from the traditional campus (American Council on Education,<br>
1996). Distance education is a key strategy in meeting the massive demand for<br>
higher education.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education is first and foremost a movement that sought not so<br>
much to challenge or change the structure of higher learning, but to extend the<br>
traditional university in order to overcome its inherent problems of scarcity<br>
and exclusivity. Second, distance education developed as a creative political<br>
response to the increasing inability of the traditional university structure to<br>
grow bigger (Hall, J., 1995). Distance education dealt with the problem of too<br>
many students in a single physical space.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing diversity in demand for education means the virtual<br>
campus is a model for the future. Developed societies are moving further from<br>
the traditional model, where people complete their education at an early age<br>
and then dedicate themselves solely to work (Warden, 1995). Simple desktop<br>
computers can now function on the Internet as powerful, multimedia, inter-<br>active communication centers. New Internet tools, such as bulletin boards,<br>
electronic tests, hyper-linked texts and sources, and enhanced computer<br>
systems with greater speed and more memory, allow viewers to see more<br>
information and tune in on discussions, meetings, theatrical performances,<br>
even operas, around the world (Gallick, 1998). Such features offer rich<br>
opportunities for distance education.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance learning is emerging as part of mainstream education (Ameri-<br>can Council on Education, 1996). So, “What is distance education and<br></p>
<hr><hr>
<p>what is its use in the United States?” To answer this question, we examine<br>
the media used in distance education, the type of student utilizing distance<br>
education, advantages and disadvantages in the use of distance education,<br>
and the players involved.</p><br>
<h2  class="A" align="center">MEDIA USED IN DISTANCE EDUCATION</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education employs media in many forms and to varying<br>
degrees. It uses mail, facsimile, radio, television, satellite broadcasts, video-<br>tapes, teleconferencing, electronic mail, chatrooms, bulletin boards, CD-<br>ROM, the Internet, and the World Wide Web.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “first generation” of distance education technologies included print,<br>
radio and television. The “second generation” added audiocassettes, video-<br>tapes, and fax. Both generations of technology were primarily one-way<br>
(asynchronous) communication from the faculty to the student.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985 and for the next ten years, CD-ROM technology was developed<br>
and used to deliver instruction. We also witnessed two-way interactive<br>
capabilities (synchronous or simultaneous, real-time communication) utiliz-<br>ing computers and computer networks, including the Internet and the World<br>
Wide Web. Audioconferencing and videoconferencing came into being.<br>
High-quality interactive videoconferencing provides additional enhance-<br>ments to distance teaching. In videoconferencing, a faculty member teaches<br>
a class in a traditional classroom setting while concurrently instructing a<br>
different group of students in another classroom via interactive video.<br>
Introducing an audio link from the remote site back to the lecturer allows live<br>
interaction and enables questions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the “virtual classroom” is a growing development in distance<br>
learning. It is usually based on computer groupware, but can be operated over<br>
the Internet. Both groupware—or “courseware”—and the Internet utilize<br>
synchronous and asynchronous instruction. In general, the student uses a local<br>
computer (usually from home) to access a range of services and facilities.<br>
These include online registration, dissemination of prepared course materials<br>
(such as the course syllabus, assignments, and practice tests), access to online<br>
video materials, and communication with instructors, tutors, and other<br>
students via electronic mail (email). Frequently, courses have their own Web<br>
page where instructors post their syllabi and assignments, as well as links to<br>
other informative Web sites, periodicals, and shared audio and video files.<br>
“Classes” and discussion groups are conducted in online chatrooms; assign-<br>ments and exams are emailed to the instructor. Discussion topics are posted<br>
to discussion or bulletin boards (“threaded discussions”); students comment<br>
on the selected topics, and they may also post new topics.<br></p>
<hr><hr>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Web is used in teaching in two different ways. A Web-Assisted<br>
    Course (WAC) has a traditional classroom setting and uses the Web to<br>
    exchange email for communication between students and instructors in<br>
    chatrooms and to download course materials and obtain grades. A Web-<br>Based Course (WBC) is a stand-alone course delivered to students who do not<br>
    meet in a traditional classroom; these students take the course from a remote<br>
    location via the Web.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States Department of Education (1999) conducted a survey<br>
    on distance education and found the following regarding the then current use<br>
    and the planned use of technology:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education courses were delivered by asynchronous Internet<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction at 58% of post-secondary institutions, by two-way inter-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active video at 54%, and by one-way prerecorded video at 47% of the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institutions in the 1997-1998 academic year. Nineteen percent of the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institutions offered courses using synchronous Internet instruction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, more institutions used several types of video technologies and<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Internet-based technologies than other modes of delivery. (p. 38)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutions planned to start using, or to increase their use of<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asynchronous Internet instruction as a primary mode of delivery<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than any other type of technology, with 82% of the institutions<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning to start or increase their use of this technology. Two-way<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interactive video (cited by 61%) and synchronous Internet instruc-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tion (cited by 60%) were also indicated as technologies planned for<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an increasing role in delivering distance education in the next three<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years. (p. 39)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The methods by which higher education institutions provide instruction<br>
    are changing rapidly. The integration of computers into teaching as we are<br>
    now experiencing may be one of the most significant contributions to<br>
    education ever known (Buikema & Ward, 1999). Now faculty have a growing<br>
    range of distance education tools allowing them to bring information re-<br>sources, simulation capabilities, and other enhancements to instruction.<br><br>
    <h2  class="A" align="center">TYPE OF STUDENT</h2>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education has a long history of serving isolated and remote<br>
    learners (American Council on Education, 1996). Today, in addition to<br>
    serving the learner who lives far from campus, distance education is aimed at<br>
    part-time students, time-strapped adult learners, and students trying to work<br>
    full time while earning degrees. Virtual classrooms are not aimed at the<br>
    traditional market of young college people, but rather are meant to serve</p>
    <hr><hr>

    <p>disciplined adult learners (Guernsey, 1998). Students are typically older than<br>
traditional undergraduates (On Line, 1998, May 22). Interestingly, the typical<br>
distance learning student is a 43 year old woman, with a $73,000 household<br>
income, who is looking for a career change or career enhancement (Lucas,<br>
1998, as cited in Buikema & Ward, 1999). The age profile of students,<br>
whether men or women, suggests that many will have family commitments.<br>
It is unlikely that they would be willing or able to leave home to attend a full-<br>time, campus-based course (Miller, Smith & Tilstone, 1998). Distance<br>
learning primarily attracts women with children. Sixty-six percent of the adult<br>
distance education market is female, and 80% of them have children (Bremner,<br>
1998). As a rule, the distance learner is serious, disciplined, conscientious,<br>
and demanding (O’Leary, 2000). According to professors who teach online<br>
courses, virtual classes require unflagging self-discipline, self-motivation,<br>
and efficient time management by the student.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education (1997) in<br>
1995, more higher education institutions offered distance education courses<br>
designed primarily for undergraduate students (81% of the institutions) and<br>
graduate students (34% of the institutions) than for any other type of student.<br>
Professionals seeking recertification were targeted by 39% of institutions<br>
offering distance education courses, and other workers seeking skill updating<br>
or retraining were targeted by 49%.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 1998, another student population emerged—students<br>
already enrolled in regular classes eager to ease their schedules by taking<br>
courses online. Many colleges and universities find students enrolled in<br>
distance education courses simultaneously enrolled in on-campus courses<br>
(“The Costs of Teaching,” 2000). Many of these students work part-time<br>
or full-time jobs and they need the freedom to manage their time (Guern-<br>sey, 1998).<br>
<h2  class="A" align="center">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF<br>
OFFERING DISTANCE EDUCATION</h2>
There are benefits and drawbacks to offering distance education. Advan-<br>tages accrue to both the student and to the institution; however, there are<br>
numerous disadvantages that must be considered.<br><br>
<h2><b>Benefits to the Student</b></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits to the student include: increased access to higher education<br>
(particularly for the nontraditional student), flexible scheduling of personal<br></p>

<hr><hr>

<p>time, convenient location (students can attend class from any corner of the<br>
globe), individualized attention by the instructor, less travel, and increased<br>
time to think about and respond to (via email or discussion boards) questions<br>
posed by the instructor (Matthews, 1999). Shy students can anonymously<br>
speak up in chatrooms. Often students who participate in online courses say<br>
they get to know one another better than in a traditional class (Buikema &<br>
Ward, 1999); chatrooms build a sense of community. Increased access to<br>
certificate and degree programs can have the further benefit of encouraging<br>
students to undertake these programs or to complete them more quickly<br>
(Turoff, 1997, as cited in U.S. Department of Education, 1999).<br>
<h2><b>Benefits to the Institution Offering Distance Education</b></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The institution also reaps benefits from offering distance education. It<br>
increases enrollment, attracts more qualified students, increases retention and<br>
graduation rates, and increases institutional prestige (Buikema & Ward,<br>
1999). In addition, offering distance education attracts new teaching staff<br>
(those interested in distance education), allows instructors freedom to be<br>
more creative in the classroom, reduces the need to build and maintain<br>
university campuses and buildings, offers a new level of communication with<br>
students, requires the university to keep abreast of new technology, and<br>
signals the public that the institution is forward thinking and technologically<br>
advanced (Matthews, 1999).<br>
<h2><b>Disadvantages</b></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous disadvantages to the student, the instructor, and the<br>
institution that must be considered when deliberating distance education.<br>
These disadvantages include, but are not limited to, the following:<br><br>
<i>Costs of Entry and Ongoing Support</i><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry and ongoing support costs to quality distance education can be<br>
substantial. Distance education is a capital-intensive business. Investments in<br>
state-of-the-art technology, computers, virtual libraries, central servers and<br>
data networks, program development costs, ongoing technical support, equip-<br>ment maintenance, hardware and software upgrades, and marketing can be<br>
expensive. Early results from a study conducted by the Western Cooperative<br>
for Educational Telecommunications on the costs of alternative forms of<br>
instructional delivery suggest that modes of delivery that rely on technology<br>
consistently cost more than face-to-face instruction (“The Costs of Teach-<br>ing,” 2000).<br></p>
<hr><hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation commissioned studies at six universities<br>
    to explore the financial costs and potential profitability of distance learning.<br>
    The universities included Drexel University, Pace University, Pennsylvania<br>
    State University, Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois,<br>
    and the University of Maryland-College Park. The researchers who con-<br>ducted the studies concluded that “universities aren’t losing a lot of money on<br>
    distance learning, but they aren’t making much, either. How well the<br>
    programs appear to be doing depends, in part, on how their costs and<br>
    revenues are defined” (Carr, 2001, p. A42). The costs of expanding<br>
    programs are, in some cases, greater than anticipated. “Several distance-<br>education leaders predict that some administrators will slow or stop their<br>
    expansion into online learning as they develop a better sense of the costs”<br>
    (Carr, p. A41). Robert E. Myers, executive vice president of the Univer-<br>sity of Maryland’s University College, states that it is a myth that online<br>
    learning is cheaper to produce and cheaper to deliver than face-to-face<br>
    instruction (Carr). “After proclaiming that distance learning would save<br>
    money, business schools are now discovering that ‘presence’ teaching is<br>
    less expensive” (Ramanantsoa, 2001, p. 12).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sobering reminder of the extent of the difficulty in implementing<br>
    distance education is California Virtual University (CVU). CVU served as a<br>
    clearinghouse for distance education programs for 98 public colleges and<br>
    universities in California. Less than one year after its creation in 1997, CVU<br>
    ceased operations. Although CVU faced a number of difficult issues, the<br>
    decision to cease operations came after the venture’s partners—the state’s<br>
    three public college systems and the Association of Independent Colleges—<br>
    balked at putting up $1 million a year for three years to cover proposed<br>
    operating costs for advertising and marketing (Blumenstyk, 1999; Young,<br>
    2000, June 30).<br><br>
    <i>Accreditation and Quality Assurance</i><br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Emmert (1997) in <i>New England’s Journal of Higher<br>
    Education and Economic Development:</i><br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hindrance to globalization of distance education is the issue<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of quality control—an area in which U.S. institutions begin with<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a disadvantage. Today, quality in American higher education is<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assessed by a complex, some say arcane, system of accreditation.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American accreditation system relies heavily upon the as-<br>sessment of proxies for educational quality, such as hours spent<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in classrooms, student-to-faculty ratios, availability of facilities,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and total resources spent on each student. Many other nations,<br></p>
    <hr><hr>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particularly in Europe, approach quality control through compe-<br>tency examinations for each discipline. Such competency assess-<br>ment de-emphasizes time to degree, instruction mode, and the<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reputation of the institution providing the instruction. These<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nations therefore may be better positioned to adopt quality<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control in distance education. (p. 21)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Internet is an ideal breeding ground for diploma mills;<br>
        a school could be fraudulent (Terry, 2000). Students must determine if a<br>
        school is properly accredited.<br><br>

        <i>Concern for Online Course Quality</i><br><br>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall lack of standards in distance education is an issue (Imel,<br>
        1996). There is no standard format for conducting an online class; therefore,<br>
        course quality is a concern. In January, 2001, the American Federation of<br>
        Teachers, one of the nation’s largest unions of educators, approved 14 quality<br>
        standards for online colleges. The guidelines call for, among other principles,<br>
        clear standards for content, technical support and counseling for students and<br>
        faculty, and training for professors in effective online teaching methods (“Is<br>
        Online Education Off Course?” 2001; Carnevale, 2001).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of instructors in the online environment is an issue. Research<br>
        has shown that some virtual universities require minimal qualifications when<br>
        hiring instructors. “The instructors hired …need only a master’s degree; they<br>
        do not enjoy tenure; they are replaceable cogs in a profit machine” (Stross,<br>
        2001, p. 37). Hiring distinguished faculty is a luxury when evaluating the<br>
        profitability of online education. “In fact, it is the opportunity to not hire full-<br>time Ph.D.’s [sic] that makes the online university such an attractive financial<br>
        proposition” (Stross, p.37).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, business leaders, whose needs are often cited by promoters<br>
        of online education, seem less certain about the quality of virtual degrees. In<br>
        an October 2000 survey, 77% of human resource officers did not consider a<br>
        degree from an online-only institution to be equivalent to a campus-based<br>
        diploma (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001). As participation in distance<br>
        education by prestigious universities increases, and students with online degrees<br>
        join the work force, business leaders will be able to reevaluate their position.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other critics argue that online learning could “facilitate the rise of a two-<br>tiered educational system—prestigious campus-based diplomas for the chil-<br>dren of elites, and mass-marketed online degrees for those less fortunate”<br>
        (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001, p.35).<br></p>
        <hr><hr>
        <i>Labor Intensity</i><br><br>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education is more time-consuming (Guernsey, 1998); it <br>
            more labor intensive to teach an online class than it is a regular chalk-and-<br>talk class (Bremner, 1998). It takes an average of 18 hours of personal time<br>
            to create one hour of stand-alone Web-based instruction. This is a two- to<br>
            fourfold increase over a traditional classroom lecture (Boettcher, 1998, as<br>
            cited in Buikema & Ward). The conversion of curriculum from classroom<br>
            to Internet is not easy or intuitive. “It is vastly harder than preparing a<br>
            classroom course, 20 times the effort,” says Eli Noam, professor of<br>
            economics and finance at Columbia Business School (Svetcov, 2000). In<br>
            addition, there is usually more time spent corresponding (email, chatrooms)<br>
            with students enrolled in an online course than in a traditional classroom<br>
            (Buikema & Ward, 1999). An American Federation of Teacher’s survey<br>
            revealed that 90% of those polled found a significant difference in<br>
            preparation time necessary for the development of a distance learning<br>
            course (“Is Online Education Off Course?” 2001). A recent University of<br>
            Illinois study found that “high-quality online teaching is time- and labor-<br>intensive” (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001, p. 34).<br></p><br>

            <i>Effectiveness of Distance Education</i><br><br>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of distance education is a hotly debated issue. An oft-<br>cited report compiled by Thomas Russell in 1999 entitled <i>The No Significant<br>
            Difference Phenomenon</i> indicates that learning outcomes of distance educa-<br>tion students are similar to the learning outcomes of traditional on-campus<br>
            students. Russell compiles this information from 355 research reports,<br>
            summaries, and papers. This body of work also suggests that the attitudes and<br>
            satisfaction of distance education students are generally positive. Other<br>
            reviews of this body of evidence are more critical, arguing that there is no<br>
            conclusive evidence to indicate this. Still others argue that the existing<br>
            evidence on the effectiveness of distance education is generally inadequate<br>
            because of experimental design flaws in the research (Van Dusen, 2000). In<br>
            addition, other studies report that students see distance education as a<br>
            convenient but less effective and less satisfying alternative for delivering<br>
            education. Among academics, the debate continues to rage about the effec-<br>tiveness of distance education.<br><br>
            <i>Commercial Versus Pedagogical Forces Driving Distance Learning</i><br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“While most educators support using technology to broaden educa-<br>tional opportunities, a growing number fear that commercial rather than<br>
            pedagogical considerations are driving the distance learning trend” (Press,<br></p>
            <hr><hr>

            <p>Washburn & Broden, 2001, p.35). A number of universities are determin-<br>ing how this technology can be used to generate a profit, rather than how<br>
                this new technology can enhance the quality of learning. Many universi-<br>ties have launched for-profit subsidiaries to market online courses, which<br>
                has aroused strong opposition among professors. Virtual education threat-<br>ens to shift control over the learning process from college educators to<br>
                administrators and marketers.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, government officials, anticipating a boost in demand for<br>
                post-secondary degrees, but reluctant to commit resources to public education<br>
                through increased taxation, embrace distance learning as a way to expand<br>
                “cheaply”—by using technology rather than bricks and mortar (Press,<br>
                Washburn & Broden, 2001).<br><br>

                <i>Need For Faculty and Staff Training</i><br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education requires a high level of instructor and staff training<br>
                (Connell, 1998). Staff and faculty need to be trained in the use of technology<br>
                (Hall, P., 1996). Faculty also need formal training in curriculum design and<br>

                distant students.<br><br>

                <i>Development of Educational Materials</i><br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to develop world-class educational materials (Emmert,<br>
                1997). Learning materials must be constructed that anticipate the learning<br>
                problems of the isolated student and provide a wide range of activities that will<br>
                support learning (Hall, P., 1996). Pedagogical adjustments are required,<br>
                particularly in the areas of class participation and course-related activities.<br><br>
                <i>Inaccessible Libraries</i><br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most academic and corporate libraries provide remote access to materi-<br>als, including journals, newspapers, magazines, and reference books. To<br>
                serve distance learners, institutions will have to digitize local materials, such<br>
                as course-related print sources. In addition, students need to have access to<br>
                books and other print sources for research; a recurrent difficulty with the<br>
                distance learning institutes is providing access to libraries. Consequently,<br>
                there is a need to convert existing physical collections into digital form<br>
                (Lynch, 2000).<br><br>
                <i>Faculty Compensation Issues</i><br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are significant and substantial challenges to faculty compensation<br>
                practices and existing norms of faculty development, including issues of<br>
